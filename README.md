Project Name: Analyzing Atlanta Crime Trends from 2009 - 2019 
Project Description: This project will be using datasets provided by the Atlanta Police Department to research crime trends over a ten year period. We hope to answer a variety of questions in this project; such as average crimes per day to see which months or weeks have the most crimes occur, which neighborhoods have the most crime and if the types of crimes committed over the 10 year period have changed, what crimes are being committed the most or least consistently?
